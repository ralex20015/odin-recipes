    <h2>Description</h2> 
    <p>Now found exclusively at one well-known pizza garden in Gravesend, Brooklyn, this style of 
        pizza was once found in neighborhood bakeries. This pizza is deceivingly light, crisp, and 
        slightly spicy. Enjoy with a can of soda.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can plain crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can pizza sauce</li>
        <li>8 ounces low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella, very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps-align">
        <li>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to 
            form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook 
            attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</li>

        <li>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly 
            grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.</li>

        <li>Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press 
            dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices 
            over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle 
            remaining olive oil over pizza.</li>

        <li>Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.</li>

        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very dark brown but 
            top is not burnt, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before slicing into 
            squares.</li>
    </ol>
